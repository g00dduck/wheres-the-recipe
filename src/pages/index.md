      Let me start by saying I love online recipes, and appreciate food
      bloggers. They're good at what they do and my kitchen would be a bland,
      sad place without them, but their actual blogs are often eye-searing
      nightmare fuel.


      Whilst wading through rambling anecdotes, affiliate link disclaimers,
      autoplay videos and other assorted horseshit, I (and, I'm guessing, you)
      often find myself exclaiming, "Where the fuck is the recipe?!" 


      So here they are: the recipes. Just the recipes.
