## About the Site

You'll hopefully notice a thing or two about this website that sets it apart from other food blogs--largely, that it's simple. Consistently so.

Every recipe post will have the following:

* A recipe title.
* A short description of the recipe.
* A link back to the original blog(s).
* The recipe, broken into an ingredient list followed by instructions!

Feel bad about not giving the orignial blogger that sweet sweet ad revenue? Not to worry! Click the link to the blog to give them their hits, then come on back to find where the fuck the recipe is.

## About the Author

Shinni is but a humble software engineer who also gets put in charge of dinner at home. Unfortunately for her spouse, she's not great in the kitchen on her own, and so often seeks the sage advice of food bloggers worldwide. She also just... can't stand most of their blogs, and often finds herself wishing that they would just. Post. The recipe.

So she does it for them.
